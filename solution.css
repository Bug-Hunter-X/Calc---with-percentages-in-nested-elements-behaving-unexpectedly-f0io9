Instead of relying on nested percentage calculations with `calc()`, consider using absolute values or adjusting the approach to layout. One option is to set explicit dimensions on the parent element or use viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) for consistent scaling across different screen sizes.  If possible, restructure your layout or use a different approach to achieve the desired effect.  Another solution is to use javascript to calculate the sizes dynamically after the page loads.
