This repository demonstrates a problem with the CSS `calc()` function when used with percentage values within nested elements.  The expected behavior is that percentages should be relative to the containing block, however, in some cases it seems that `calc()` is basing the percentage off of a parent element. This issue can result in unexpected layout and dimensions, particularly when dealing with responsive design.  The `solution.css` file provides a potential workaround.
